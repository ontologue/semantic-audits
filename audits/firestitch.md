# Semantic Infrastructure Audit Report

**Domain:** [firestitch.com](https://firestitch.com)  
**Organization Type:** Digital Development Agency  
**Audit Date:** December 2024

## Executive Summary

Firestitch is a custom digital solutions agency with 15 years of experience specializing in web and mobile app development across multiple industries. Our audit reveals limited Wikidata presence (2/5 entities found, 40%) but excellent Schema.org implementation across all analyzed pages with comprehensive structured data markup.

## 🔍 Wikidata Presence Analysis

| Entity | Type | Wikidata Status | Details |
|--------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Firestitch** | Organization | ❌ Not found | Primary entity missing - key opportunity for brand authority |
| **TUIO** | Product/Service | ✅ Found | [Q136649061](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q136649061) \| 22 statements \| 22 properties \| 5 sources \| 🟢 Complete |
| **Lumacare** | Organization | ❌ Not found | Healthcare client - potential notable entity |
| **Athena** | Product/Service | ✅ Found | [Q1941308](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1941308) \| 4 statements \| 4 properties \| 4 sources \| 🔴 Stub |
| **Firestitch Toolkit** | Product | ❌ Not found | Proprietary toolkit with 100+ components - innovation opportunity |

**Summary:** 2/5 entities found (40% coverage)

### Key Findings
- **Strong individual entries:** TUIO shows excellent data completeness with comprehensive sourcing
- **Development opportunity:** Athena entity exists but requires significant enhancement
- **Missing core presence:** The main Firestitch organization lacks Wikidata representation despite 15 years of operation

## 📊 Notability Signals

| Platform | Status | Impact |
|----------|--------|---------|
| LinkedIn | ✅ Found | Professional presence supports organizational notability |
| Crunchbase | ❌ Not found | Missing startup/business database entry |
| Wikipedia | ❌ Not found | No encyclopedic coverage identified |
| GitHub | ❌ Not found | Limited public code repository presence |
| Twitter | ❌ Not found | Minimal social media footprint |
| Funding | ❌ Not found | No public funding rounds documented |
| Press | ❌ Not found | Limited media coverage identified |

**Impact Note:** LinkedIn presence provides foundational notability, but additional external signals would strengthen Wikidata inclusion criteria and overall digital authority.
