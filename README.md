## Why This Matters

When someone asks an LLM "What are the best AI tools for [your use case]", does your company appear in the answer?

If you're not in Wikidata with proper Schema.org markup, the answer is likely **no**.

Your competitors with semantic infrastructure are getting discovered. You're not.
